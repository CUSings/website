CU Sings: People's Chorus was established to fill a need in the Champaign-Urbana community where people of diverse backgrounds, socio-economic status and musical accomplishment could come together to create high-quality music, and build a community of inclusivity and acceptance.
We knew we were filling a deep need when nearly eighty people turned up to our very first rehearsal --- and we aren't going to stop there! In just a few short months we've been able to provide artistic and musical vitality throughout Champaign-Urbana by serving our vibrant arts community more than we've ever been able to before.

Should you be in a position to support us financially, we invite you to invest in our important mission to create a welcoming and inclusive space for all who need it. Your gift makes it possible for anyone who wants to join our choir to do so, as well as help us build programs to serve and uplift the most vulnerable and marginalized in our community. Just $25 can purchase one memberâ€™s music for a concert series. A donation of $150 can help us hire professional instrumentalists to elevate our performances.
