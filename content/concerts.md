A New Dawn not only reflects the fresh start of this concert season but also the hopeful future of the People's Chorus, as it continues to grow and shape the musical landscape of its community. The choir's expansion and achievements serve as a testament to the power of choral music to bring people together, to inspire, and to create something greater than the sum of its parts. With its inclusive spirit, high artistic standards, and commitment to community, the People's Chorus represents the dawning of a new era for choral music in Champaign Urbana, where everyone has a voice, and every voice contributes to the light.

The People's Chorus had a fall concert, "A New Dawn," on October 19, 2024 in collaboration with Amasong and the UU Church Choir.
