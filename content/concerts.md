In the darkness at the ending of the year, there will be light and joy--and carols for all! Join CU Sings: People's Chorus for a musical celebration of the season, accompanied by:

- The Unitarian Universalist Church CrUUners
- Sycamore Brass Ensemble with guest percussionists
- ...and special guest performer Ricardo Herrera!

Carols for All will feature seasonal music from a variety of cultural traditions including Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Pagan, and secular/restorative justice-themed works.  You might even get to "jingle" a few bells along with us!

# Past concerts

A New Dawn not only reflects the fresh start of this concert season but also the hopeful future of the People's Chorus, as it continues to grow and shape the musical landscape of its community. The choir's expansion and achievements serve as a testament to the power of choral music to bring people together, to inspire, and to create something greater than the sum of its parts. With its inclusive spirit, high artistic standards, and commitment to community, the People's Chorus represents the dawning of a new era for choral music in Champaign Urbana, where everyone has a voice, and every voice contributes to the light.

The People's Chorus had a fall concert, "A New Dawn," on October 19, 2024 in collaboration with Amasong and the UU Church Choir.
